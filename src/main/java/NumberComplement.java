 *
 * Given a positive integer, output its complement number.
 * The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

 Note:
 The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
 You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
 Input: 5
 Output: 2
 Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits),
 and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

    /**
     * According to the problem, the result is

     The flipped version of the original input but
     Only flip N bits within the range from LEFTMOST bit of 1 to RIGHTMOST.
     For example input = 5 (the binary representation is 101),
     the LEFTMOST bit of 1 is the third one from RIGHTMOST (100, N = 3).
     Then we need to flip 3 bits from RIGHTMOST and the answer is 010
     To achieve above algorithm, we need to do 3 steps:

     Create a bit mask which has N bits of 1 from RIGHTMOST. In above example,
     the mask is 111. And we can use the decent Java built-in function Integer.highestOneBit
     to get the LEFTMOST bit of 1, left shift one, and then minus one.
     Please remember this wonderful trick to create bit masks with N ones at RIGHTMOST,
     you will be able to use it later.
     Negate the whole input number.
     Bit AND numbers in step 1 and 2.
